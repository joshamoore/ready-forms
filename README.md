##Usage

To install Ready-Forms, add the ready-forms folder to your website root, and include the following lines in the <head> section of your web page.

<link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='ready-forms/css/ready-forms.css' />
<script type="text/javascript" src="ready-forms/js/ready-forms.js"></script>

Now to use Ready-Forms, create a form input as usual and simply add the corresponding class name to the input and the styling and validation will be done for you.

The naming conventions for inputs are as follows:

*ready-forms-text-required
*ready-forms-text

When a field is required it will be validated, simply remove 'required' to add styling.

##Full List of Class Names

*ready-forms-text

Add '-required' at the end of a class name to enable validation.
